# CR7-News
Python GUI Application to take care of my CR7 addiction!

### What is it used for?
I am a huge fan of Cristiano Ronaldo(CR7)! and I had a serious problem of constantly checking out **goal.com** in between my work to see if any news about Cristiano Ronaldo is published or not. Even if there was no news about him I would end up wasting my precious minutes on the website reading other attractive articles. But now I just open this application and if any news about CR7 is published on goal.com it feeds it into this application. Feeds can be refreshed anytime by pressing the refresh button and any news item can be deleted if you have read it by using the remove button.
