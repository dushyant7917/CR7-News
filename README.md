# CR7-News
Python GUI Application to take care of my CR7 addiction!

###Before
I had a serious problem of constantly checking out *goal.com* in between my work to check out any news about Cristiano Ronaldo.
Even if there is no news about him I would end up wasting my precious minutes on the website reading other attractive articles.
###After
But now I just open this application and if any news about CR7 is published on *goal.com* it feeds it into this application.
And if there is anything on its screen about my favourite star then only I visit the website for reading the complete article.
You can refresh the feeds anytime by pressing the refresh button and you can delete any news if you have read it by using the remove button. Deleted news won't ever come back again.

###Using the application
You can use the application by running the *CR7News* executable file in the */Executable* directory.
