# CR7-News
Python GUI Application to take care of my CR7 addiction!

###Before
I had a serious problem of constantly checking out **goal.com** in between my work to check out any news about Cristiano Ronaldo.
Even if there is no news about him I would end up wasting my precious minutes on the website reading other attractive articles.
###After
But now I just open this application and if any news about CR7 is published on goal.com it feeds it into this application.
And if there is anything on its screen about my favourite star then only I visit the website for reading the complete article.
You can refresh the feeds anytime by pressing the refresh button and you can delete any news if you have read it by using the remove button. Deleted news won't ever come back again.

###Using the application
####For Linux Users
You can use the application by running the **CR7News** executable file in the **/Executable** directory.
####For Windows Users
```
pip install pyinstaller
```
```
pyinstaller CR7News.py
```
After the above steps CR7News executable file for windows will be made in the **/dist** directory.
Create **News.db** and **RemovedNews.db** files in the **/dist** directory and run the CR7News executable to start using the app.
